THIS DOES NOT WORK (yet?). DON'T EXPECT THIS TO WORK. IT DOES
NOT WORK.

It's a php version of a personal budget system that I've used on 
paper for years.  It keeps track of how much has been spent in 
a given number of weeks (typically I refresh it each month when
I get paid).  The top card is fixed expenses (e.g., bills), the
middle a check list of money earmarked for groceries and food, 
and the bottom is 'walking around money' in a check list in $20
increments.
